# Type Error in TypeScript
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function's return type does not match the actual return value.  The `concatenateStrings` function is declared to return a number but attempts to return a string concatenation.  This results in a type error during compilation.

The solution demonstrates how to correct the return type or modify the function's logic to ensure type consistency.
